## Project Description

In this project we implemented and compared three different deep leanring models in order to correctly classify X-ray chest images. <br />
The possible classes are: Normal(N), Pneumonia(P) and Tubercolosis(T). <br />

## Models

The implemented models are the following:
- Model from scratch
- Tranfer learning of InceptionResnet
- Transfer learning of EfficientNet

## Explainability

In order to understand if there was bias in the model predictions, we implemented the following explainable AI methods:
- GradCam
- Shap
